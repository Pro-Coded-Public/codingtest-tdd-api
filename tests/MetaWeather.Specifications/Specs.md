Problem:

Create an ASP.NET MVC application that will display the weather forecast for the next 5 days in
Belfast.

Proposed Solution:

Create an authenticated web application using React where only authorised users can access the
weather forecast. Use out of the box authentication mechanisms.

The application will communicate to the following REST API: https://www.metaweather.com/api/
and retrieve the next 5 days of weather for Belfast.

Create a list containing the weather forecast for each of the next 5 days, this will include the date,
the weather state and an image to represent the weather state.

The application will include the ability to pull to refresh, which will update with the latest forecast,
which in turn updates the list.

Hints:

URL for snow image can be found here:
https://www.metaweather.com/static/img/weather/png/sn.png
Replace the weather state abbreviation (sn) in the image filename with the desired state.
